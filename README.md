# Description
Independent micro frontends with Single SPA library.
It is similar with microservices technique but microfrontends are independent frontend components.
In this example i use mainly react because i'm more acquainted with this framework and in rakings component i use vue.js(sorry for hard-coding)
Î¥ou can use whatever frontend framework you want.
Here is the structure of the project.
